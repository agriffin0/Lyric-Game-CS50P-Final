Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,The moon like a spotlight on the lake
Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,September saw a month of tears
Picture To Burn,Taylor Swift,I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,Can he tell that I can't breathe?
Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,I fake a smile so he won't see
A Place In This World,Taylor Swift,Trying to see through the rain coming down
A Place In This World,Taylor Swift,"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
A Place In This World,Taylor Swift,And tomorrow's just a mystery
Cold As You,Taylor Swift,"You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you"
The Outside,Taylor Swift,So how can I ever try to be better?
Tied Together With A Smile,Taylor Swift,You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
Stay Beautiful,Taylor Swift,You're really gonna be someone / Ask anyone
Stay Beautiful,Taylor Swift,If what you are is a daydream / I'll never get to hold
Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,"You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance"
Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,But do you honestly expect me to believe / We could ever be the same?
Mary's Song,Taylor Swift,Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Mary's Song,Taylor Swift,The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
Fearless,Fearless,I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
Fearless,Fearless,Absentmindedly makin' me want you
Fifteen,Fearless,Don't forget to look before you fall
Love Story,Fearless,We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
Love Story,Fearless,Wondering if you were ever coming around
Hey Stephen,Fearless,Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
White Horse,Fearless,"Begging for forgiveness, begging for me"
Breathe,Fearless,"Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt"
Tell Me Why,Fearless,"You tell me that you love me, then cut me down"
You're Not Sorry,Fearless,You used to shine so bright / But I watched all of it fade
The Way I Loved You,Fearless,Got away by some mistake and now
Forever & Always,Fearless,Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
The Best Day,Fearless,And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
Change,Fearless,Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
Mine,Speak Now,Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
Sparks Fly,Speak Now,"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
Back To December,Speak Now,So this is me swallowing my pride
Back To December,Speak Now,So if the chain is on your door I understand
Speak Now,Speak Now,This is surely not what you thought it would be
Dear John,Speak Now,I'm shining like fireworks
Mean,Speak Now,Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
The Story Of Us,Speak Now,Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
The Story Of Us,Speak Now,The battle's in your hands now
Never Grow Up,Speak Now,"Remember the footsteps, remember the words said"
Enchanted,Speak Now,"2 AM, who do you love?"
Better Than Revenge,Speak Now,Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
Innocent,Speak Now,You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
Haunted,Speak Now,Something's made your eyes go cold
Last Kiss,Speak Now,"Your name, forever the name on my lips"
Long Live,Speak Now,How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
State Of Grace,RED,We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
Red,RED,Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Treacherous,RED,I hear the sound of my own voice / Asking you to stay
I Knew You Were Trouble,RED,And when I fell hard you took a step back
All Too Well,RED,"Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it"
22,RED,You look like bad news
I Almost Do,RED,In my dreams you're touching my face
We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,RED,And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
Stay Stay Stay,RED,You took the time to memorize me
The Last Time,RED,Put my name at the top of your list
Holy Ground,RED,Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Sad Beautiful Tragic,RED,"And you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me"
The Lucky One,RED,And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
Everything Has Changed,RED,And your eyes look like coming home
Starlight,RED,Don't you dream impossible things?
Begin Again,RED,And for the first time what's past is past
Welcome To New York,1989,Like any great love it keeps you guessing

This Love,1989,In silent screams and wildest dreams
I Know Places,1989,Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Clean,1989,Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

Vigilante Shit,Midnights,Ladies know what people want
Bejeweled,Midnights,I think it's time to teach some lessons
Labyrinth,Midnights,I thought the plane was goin' down
Karma,Midnights,Weave your little webs of opacity
Sweet Nothing,Midnights,Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
Mastermind,Midnights,Strategy sets the scene for the tale
