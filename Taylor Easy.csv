Song,Album,Lyric
Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,He said the way my blue eyes shined / Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
Picture To Burn,Taylor Swift,You're a redneck heartbreak / Who's really bad at lying
Picture To Burn,Taylor Swift,So watch me strike a match / On all my wasted time
Picture To Burn,Taylor Swift,And if you come around saying sorry to me / My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,Drew looks at me / I fake a smile so he won't see
Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,"I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about"
Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
A Place In This World,Taylor Swift,"Got the radio on, my old blue jeans / And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve"
A Place In This World,Taylor Swift,"Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine / Could you tell me what more do I need"
Cold As You,Taylor Swift,And you come away with a great little story / Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
The Outside,Taylor Swift,I tried to take the road less traveled by / But nothing seems to work the first few times
Tied Together With A Smile,Taylor Swift,Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty / Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
Stay Beautiful,Taylor Swift,Cory's eyes are like a jungle
Stay Beautiful,Taylor Swift,I'm taking pictures in my mind / So I can save them for a rainy day
Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,"It's strange to think the songs we used to sing / The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone"
Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,"It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes."""
Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,And I should've been there in the back of your mind
Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,"Before you go, tell me this: / Was it worth it?"
Mary's Song,Taylor Swift,Take me back when our world was one block wide
Mary's Song,Taylor Swift,"We were sitting at our favorite spot in town / And you looked at me, got down on one knee"
Our Song,Taylor Swift,I was riding shotgun / With my hair undone
Our Song,Taylor Swift,He's got a one-hand feel / On the steering wheel / The other on my heart
Our Song,Taylor Swift,"Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window"
Fearless,Fearless,There's somethin' 'bout the way / The street looks when it's just rained
Fearless,Fearless,And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
Fearless,Fearless,You take my hand and drag me head first
Fifteen,Fearless,You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Fifteen,Fearless,"Well, count to ten, take it in / this is life before you know who you're gonna be"
Fifteen,Fearless,You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
Fifteen,Fearless,Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Love Story,Fearless,We were both young when I first saw you
Love Story,Fearless,"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles"
Love Story,Fearless,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
Hey Stephen,Fearless,Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window / I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen,Fearless,Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
White Horse,Fearless,Say you're sorry / That face of an angel / Comes out just when you need it to
White Horse,Fearless,Maybe I was naïve / Got lost in your eyes / And never really had a chance
White Horse,Fearless,"My mistake, I didn't know to be in love / You had to fight to have the upper hand"
You Belong With Me,Fearless,You're on the phone with your girlfriend / She's upset
You Belong With Me,Fearless,But she wears short skirts / I wear T-shirts
You Belong With Me,Fearless,Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
Breathe,Fearless,I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Breathe,Fearless,Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie / It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
Tell Me Why,Fearless,"I took a chance, I took a shot / And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not"
You're Not Sorry,Fearless,All this time I was wasting / Hoping you would come around
You're Not Sorry,Fearless,And you can tell me that you're sorry / But I don't believe you baby / Like I did before
The Way I Loved You,Fearless,He is sensible and so incredible / And all my single friends are jealous
The Way I Loved You,Fearless,But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
The Way I Loved You,Fearless,He can't see the smile I'm faking / And my heart's not breaking
Forever & Always,Fearless,Once upon a time / I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
Forever & Always,Fearless,"Oh, and it rains in your bedroom / Everything is wrong"
Forever & Always,Fearless,"Oh, back up, baby, back up / Did you forget everything?"
The Best Day,Fearless,"I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on"
Change,Fearless,And it's a sad picture / The final blow hits you
Change,Fearless,So we've been outnumbered / Raided and now cornered
Change,Fearless,"Tonight we stand, get off our knees / Fight for what we've worked for all these years"
Mine,Speak Now,You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Mine,Speak Now,"Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?"
Mine,Speak Now,And I remember that fight / Two-thirty AM / As everything was slipping right out of our hands
Sparks Fly,Speak Now,The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
Sparks Fly,Speak Now,Drop everything now / Meet me in the pouring rain
Back To December,Speak Now,I'm so glad you made time to see me / How's life? Tell me how's your family?
Back To December,Speak Now,Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
Back To December,Speak Now,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Speak Now,Speak Now,I am not the kind of girl / Who should be rudely barging in on a white-veil occasion
Dear John,Speak Now,Long were the nights / When my days once revolved around you
Dear John,Speak Now,Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Mean,Speak Now,"You, with your words like knives / And swords and weapons that you use against me"
Mean,Speak Now,"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me"
The Story Of Us,Speak Now,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
Never Grow Up,Speak Now,Your little hand's wrapped around my finger / And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Enchanted,Speak Now,The playful conversation starts / Counter all your quick remarks
Enchanted,Speak Now,"This night is sparkling, don't you let it go"
Better Than Revenge,Speak Now,Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Better Than Revenge,Speak Now,She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
Innocent,Speak Now,Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days? / Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Innocent,Speak Now,"Oh, who you are is not where you've been"
Haunted,Speak Now,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this"
Last Kiss,Speak Now,But now I'll go sit on the floor / Wearing your clothes
Last Kiss,Speak Now,You can plan for a change in weather and time / But I never planned on you changing your mind
Long Live,Speak Now,I said remember this moment / In the back of my mind
Long Live,Speak Now,It was the end of a decade / But the start of an age
State Of Grace,RED,"We are alone, just you and me / Up in your room and our slates are clean"
State Of Grace,RED,This is the golden age of something good and right and real
Red,RED,Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Treacherous,RED,Put your lips close to mine / As long as they don't touch
I Knew You Were Trouble,RED,"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago / I was in your sights, you got me alone"
All Too Well,RED,I walked through the door with you
All Too Well,RED,"Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze"
22,RED,It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
22,RED,"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time"
I Almost Do,RED,I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,RED,I remember when we broke up the first time
Stay Stay Stay,RED,"I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time"
Stay Stay Stay,RED,It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life
The Last Time,RED,You wear your best apology / But I was there to watch you leave
Holy Ground,RED,"I was reminiscing just the other day / While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away"
Sad Beautiful Tragic,RED,"Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late"
Sad Beautiful Tragic,RED,"Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait"
The Lucky One,RED,New to town with a made up name in the angel's city / Chasing fortune and fame
Everything Has Changed,RED,"All I knew this morning when I woke / Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before"
Starlight,RED,"The whole place was dressed to the nines / And we were dancing, dancing"
Begin Again,RED,He didn't like it when I wore high heels / but I do
Begin Again,RED,Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
