Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,And I was right there beside him all summer long / And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
Tim McGraw,Taylor Swift,When you think happiness / I hope you think that little black dress
Picture To Burn,Taylor Swift,"State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy"
Picture To Burn,Taylor Swift,I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
Picture To Burn,Taylor Swift,There's nothing stopping me / From going out with all of your best friends
Picture To Burn,Taylor Swift,And if you're missing me / You'd better keep it to yourself
Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Teardrops On My Guitar,Taylor Swift,I'll put his picture down / And maybe get some sleep tonight

Cold As You,Taylor Swift,"And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you"
The Outside,Taylor Swift,You could've helped if you had wanted to / But no one notices until it's too late to do anything
Tied Together With A Smile,Taylor Swift,"Hold on, baby, you're losing it"
Tied Together With A Smile,Taylor Swift,I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
Stay Beautiful,Taylor Swift,He whispers songs into my window / In words that nobody knows
Stay Beautiful,Taylor Swift,It's hard to make a conversation / When he's taking my breath away
Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
Should've Said No,Taylor Swift,"I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"""

You Belong With Me,Fearless,You say you're fine I know you better than that
Breathe,Fearless,People are people and sometimes we change our minds
Breathe,Fearless,"It's 2 AM, feeling like I just lost a friend"

Back To December,Speak Now,You gave me roses and I left them there to die
Back To December,Speak Now,"And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind"
Speak Now,Speak Now,Horrified looks from everyone in the room / But I'm only looking at you
Dear John,Speak Now,"Well, maybe it's me / And my blind optimism / To blame"
